# ASU Applied Math Student Paper Club 

**Description and purpose:** Each week, a different member of the club presents the results of a recent applied math research paper to the rest of the club. That way, each club member gets to learn about many different papers throughout the semester but only has to read one or two. In addition to spreading knowledge, this will help students become better researchers and presenters. 

**Meeting time and place:** Wednesdays from 9-10 a.m. in WXLR A202 

**Contact:** For more information, contact Kimball Johnston (<kjohn313@asu.edu>)
